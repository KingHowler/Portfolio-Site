        <h1 class="sub-heading">Draft 2 - Absolutely Horrible</h1>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Born in the city of Lahore, Pakistan; I am someone who has had a fascination with the world of science and
            technology from when I was just a toddler.
            I have worked on numerous projects and, in the previous year, vastly increased the scope of my capabilities.
            I now have a good foundation for <strong>Software Development</strong>, including desktop applications and
            web applications;
            I am an expert, as much as a 17-year-old should be, in <strong>Robotics</strong>;
            I am well acquainted with <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> concepts and practices and recently I have
            even begun to dabble in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>.
            Though I suppose you are not here to read this.</p>

        <h3>School Life</h3>
        <p>I have always been among the popular "fun" people to be around in school.
            Therefore, I was known by almost half the entire student body in both of the two schools I have been in,
            when I was there atleast.</p>

        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p>Enough talk about my school life and friends, let's go deeper starting with my personality.
            Frankly speaking, I am an attention seeker.
            In fact, I started Robotics and Computer Science at the early age of 12 so that I would be praised for being
            early for it.
            Moreover, I am also very social and like to spend as much time with my friends as possible.
            I try to make as many memories as I can during the short period of time that we are together.
            I am <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a bit</span> very lazy.
            As a matter of fact, I finish most of my tasks just before their respective deadlines, but I assure you I
            don't leave anything overdue.
            I also eat a lot for a guy with my build, but I don't really gain any weight due to all the running I do a
            lot while playing sports.
            I play a small number of sports including <strong>Football</strong>, <strong>Table Tennis</strong> and
            <strong>Badminton</strong>.
            I am an athletic person and Football is among my favorite sports.
            On the other hand I am also excellent in my academics, though there are ups and downs which I must admit.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Preferences</h3>
        <p>Next up are my preferences and hobbies;
            I don't listen to a wide variety of music, only something with a meaning or a context such as songs
            regarding a video game or a popular TV Show.
            I also listen to motivational-ish music.
            My favorite band being <strong>Imagine Dragons</strong>, followed by <strong>The Score</strong> and
            <strong>The Skillet</strong>.
            I watch a <strong>LOT</strong> of movies and have watched many action thriller, Superhero movies, Sci-fi
            movies and even psychological movies my favorite of which is titled as <strong>"Fractured"</strong>
        </p>

        <h1 class="sub-heading">Draft 3 - We are getting somewhere</h1>
        <h3>How the story began</h3>
        <p>
            There was a time when I was always second, sometimes third and at other times I couldn't even achieve that.
            There was nothing that I could ever truly excel in.
            I could never be first, never be the one who stood in the front of the class as everyone clapped for me.
            My language skills were weak, I couldn't memorize all the different cases and exceptions in Chemistry and
            Biology, and History was painfully boring.
            Eventually I decided to give up, "Who wants to be first anyways? It's not that special" is what I thought.
            I had resigned myself, losing all interest in pursuing anything, and for some time I couldn't even keep up
            with my past scores.
            Fortunately, this didn't last long. In 4th grade we were introduced to our school's new computer lab and it
            was then that we were given our very first practical task.
            The teacher had asked us to draw a cool water bottle in MS Paint. Everyone wanted to draw their own desires
            but were failing poorly, everyone except for me.
            For some reason, all it took was one look and I knew exactly what to do.
            I had finished my task in just minutes while everyone else took an hour or more and even then, my drawing
            was much better than the others.
            For the first time ever, I was the very best. With that cam the burning question "Why stop here?".
        </p>

        <h3>What did I do next?</h3>
        <p>
            I had found my calling and now it was time to go big.
            I started learning how to use Microsoft Excel, Word and PowerPoint. I began HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ and
            Python; Started with Robotics, Raw Computing and Electrical Engineering as well.
            I just kept learning and learning, always a hundred steps ahead of everyone, but soon everyone began to
            catch up.
            I started programming and Robotics in a time when it wasn't well known by most people. In fact, nobody in my
            previous school, including most teachers, didn't know that Robotics actually existed.
            Nowadays everyone is running towards it, and the uniqueness I once had is now slowly becoming "Common".
            Frustration once again started to take hold and I began to question myself. What do I have to show for all
            those years of hard work? I have done a lot yet I have nothing decent or monumental to show.<br> Who am I?
        </p>

        <h3>Who I have become</h3>
        <p>
            I am Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, a 17-year old student. I am an attention seeker and try my best to be noticed.
            I am a people's person and get lonely quite easily. I like to make new friends and spend time with old ones,
            whether it's out to the movies or amusement parks, I always manage to make time.
            I love my parents and I help them out whenever possible. I like the feeling of independence, I prefer to buy
            things using my own money, I like to do my own chores or work and I like to build things on my own.
            Although, I still appreciate a helping hand every now and then. I know what my limits are, and I would still
            push against it, gaining a centimeter of progress every day, slowly but surely. I know what I can't control
            and am alright with it.
            I am a realist who always takes the third person's perspective when making important decisions, free from
            any arbitrary biases. I tend to see what others can't and somehow still miss the most obvious details.
            I am not a natural born leader but when the situation asks of me I will step up, just as I have all these
            past year. Even if I can't give a world class performance, I certainly can give a performance you won't
            forget.
        </p>

        <h1 class="sub-heading">Draft 3.5 (ChatGPT and Grammarly's revision of Draft 3)</h1>
        <p>There was a time when I was always second, sometimes third, and sometimes even lower. I could never be the
            one standing in front of the class as everyone clapped. The language was a struggle, Chemistry & Biology
            overwhelmed me with memorization, and History felt tedious. Eventually, I resigned myself to being average.
            "Who wants to be first, anyway?" I thought. Then, in 4th grade, we were introduced to our school’s computer
            lab. For our first practical task, our teacher asked us to draw a water bottle in MS Paint. To my surprise,
            I finished in minutes while others struggled. For the first time, I was the very best. And with that came
            the question: "Why stop here?"</p>
        <p>Finding my spark in tech, I dove headfirst into everything I could: learning Excel, Word, PowerPoint, HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python, and more. I explored robotics and electrical engineering, driven by the thrill
            of being ahead. But as tech’s popularity grew, I began to lose the edge that had once made me unique.
            Frustration crept in, and I questioned myself: "What do I have to show for all these years?" While I had
            learned a lot, I felt like I had nothing truly monumental to prove it. I wanted to create something
            representing all my hard work, to finally answer the question:<br> Who am I?</p>
        <p>I am Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, a 17-year-old passionate about exploring, building, and pushing limits. I love
            connecting with people, making friends, and balancing independence with a helping hand when needed. I take
            pride in helping my parents and savor the feeling of doing things independently. I’m not a natural-born
            leader, but I step up when the situation calls for it, aiming to deliver a memorable impact. I know what I
            can control and have learned to be at peace with what I cannot. With every step I take, I strive to leave a
            mark—not by following the usual path, but by blazing my own.</p>

        <h1 class="sub-heading">Draft 4 - Almost Final</h1>
        <p>
            When I was just an 11-year-old, my sister developed an annoying liking to creeping up behind me and trying
            to scare me.
            She would sneak into my room when I was focused on important work and startle me, <strong>FOR FUN</strong>.
            One day, I had enough and was fixated on finding a solution.
            It was then that I fatefully stumbled upon a tutorial for a self-made intruder alarm.
        </p>
        <p>
            That crucial moment, which arose from such a trivial matter, changed the course of my life.
            I found out about Robotics, which became my passion.
            My very first project was, in fact, the very same intruder alarm (and it worked wonders for my problem).
            Being the ambitious child I was, I had a dream now.
            I wished to master technology in its entirety.
            I soon poked at Software Engineering and Basic Electronics.
            It felt like solving puzzles, each more exciting than the last.
            I didn't like to be a strain on my parents, so I decided to pay for my newfound hobby by saving up my lunch
            money.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology has undoubtedly been the most influential thing in my life, but it wasn't the only one.
            Growing up, most kids my age only had one hobby: playing video games on their parent's phones.
            I, however, wasn't interested in them.
            I had, of course, played them but nothing about them stuck to me.
            Even now, if someone were to ask me “What hobbies do you have other than Robotics?”, I would say that they
            were <strong>Football</strong> and <strong>Reading</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's unusual for a tech geek to be athletic, but during those days I played Football quite a lot, especially
            during my O levels.
            On the other hand, I was a frequent reader.
            Having read all the <em>Harry Potter</em> books, I had fancied novels.
            I was particularly interested in the genres of <strong>Fiction</strong> and <strong>Crime</strong>, with my
            favorite among them being the <em>Nervernight Chronicles by Jay Kristoff</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that naive age, I couldn't possibly have known how each decision and each action would shape me into who I have become now.
            Now I can boast a wide variety of skills and a certain amount of mastery in many fields including, but not limited to, Physics; Computer Engineering; Electrical Engineering; Kinematics & Dynamics as well as others.
            I have reached a point in my life that I would never have expected to when I chose Technology.
            Still, there is a burning question in me.
            How much further?
        </p>
        <p>
            I am not satisfied just yet.
            I won't be until I have proof that I finished my goal.
            I desire a definitive proof that differentiates me from the common hobbyist.
            That is why I am going to climb even greater heights.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had an early start as compared to most others, but the one thing I did not have was guidance.
            YouTube tutorials could only take me so far, and soon every student began to learn Robotics and began to catch up to me, the advantage I once had was gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, some of my friends started an organization to teach children about Robotics.
            I joined them as soon as I found out, and I was thrilled at the opportunity.
            I truly regret not being able to find someone who could have helped me when I started, but being able to be that someone for others helped me forget about it.
            For the same reason, I also offered an online course for Digital Electronics to my juniors in school who had learned Robotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, if I were to describe myself in three words, it would be “Student of all”.
            I like to learn everything; I enjoy helping my fellows in their learnings and I enjoy learning from those with greater knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking back, it's astonishing how a simple desire to outwit my sister led me to discover a lifelong passion.
            From crafting an intruder alarm at 11 to teaching others the fundamentals of technology, my journey has been fueled by curiosity and determination.
            Yet, despite all I've learned, I remain far from content.
            Each new project, book, or challenge only deepens my hunger for knowledge.
            I am still starving for more—eager to explore the uncharted, solve the unsolved, and learn from the world around me.
