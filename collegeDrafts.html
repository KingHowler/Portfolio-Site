        <h1 class="colorWheel">Draft 2 - Absolutely Horrible</h1>

        <h3 class="colorWheel">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        Born in the city of Lahore, Pakistan; I am someone who has had a fascination with the world of science and technology from when I was just a toddler.
        I have worked on numerous projects and, in the previous year, vastly increased the scope of my capabilities.
        I now have a good foundation for <strong>Software Development</strong>, including desktop applications and web applications; 
        I am an expert, as much as a 17-year-old should be, in <strong>Robotics</strong>;
        I am well acquainted with <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> concepts and practices and recently I have even begun to dabble in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>.
        Though I suppose you are not here to read this.</p>
        
        <h3 class="colorWheel">School Life</h3>
        <p>I have always been among the popular "fun" people to be around in school.
        Therefore, I was known by almost half the entire student body in both of the two schools I have been in, when I was there atleast.</p>
        
        <h3 class="colorWheel">Personality</h3>
        <p>Enough talk about my school life and friends, let's go deeper starting with my personality.
        Frankly speaking, I am an attention seeker.
        In fact, I started Robotics and Computer Science at the early age of 12 so that I would be praised for being early for it.
        Moreover, I am also very social and like to spend as much time with my friends as possible.
        I try to make as many memories as I can during the short period of time that we are together.
        I am <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a bit</span> very lazy.
        As a matter of fact, I finish most of my tasks just before their respective deadlines, but I assure you I don't leave anything overdue.
        I also eat a lot for a guy with my build, but I don't really gain any weight due to all the running I do a lot while playing sports.
        I play a small number of sports including <strong>Football</strong>, <strong>Table Tennis</strong> and <strong>Badminton</strong>.
        I am an athletic person and Football is among my favorite sports.
        On the other hand I am also excellent in my academics, though there are ups and downs which I must admit.</p>
        
        <h3 class="colorWheel">Personal Preferences</h3>
        <p>Next up are my preferences and hobbies;
        I don't listen to a wide variety of music, only something with a meaning or a context such as songs regarding a video game or a popular TV Show.
        I also listen to motivational-ish music.
        My favorite band being <strong>Imagine Dragons</strong>, followed by <strong>The Score</strong> and <strong>The Skillet</strong>.
        I watch a <strong>LOT</strong> of movies and have watched many action thriller, Superhero movies, Sci-fi movies and even psychological movies my favorite of which is titled as <strong>"Fractured"</strong></p>

        <h1 class="colorWheel">Draft 3 - We are getting somewhere</h1>
        <h3 class="colorWheel">How the story began</h3>
        <p>
            There was a time when I was always second, sometimes third and at other times I couldn't even achieve that. There was nothing that I could ever truly excel in.
            I could never be first, never be the one who stood in the front of the class as everyone clapped for me.
            My language skills were weak, I couldn't memorize all the different cases and exceptions in Chemistry and Biology, and History was painfully boring.
            Eventually I decided to give up, "Who wants to be first anyways? It's not that special" is what I thought.
            I had resigned myself, losing all interest in pursuing anything, and for some time I couldn't even keep up with my past scores.
            Fortunately, this didn't last long. In 4th grade we were introduced to our school's new computer lab and it was then that we were given our very first practical task.
            The teacher had asked us to draw a cool water bottle in MS Paint. Everyone wanted to draw their own desires but were failing poorly, everyone except for me.
            For some reason, all it took was one look and I knew exactly what to do.
            I had finished my task in just minutes while everyone else took an hour or more and even then, my drawing was much better than the others.
            For the first time ever, I was the very best. With that cam the burning question "Why stop here?".
        </p>

        <h3 class="colorWheel">What did I do next?</h3>
        <p>
            I had found my calling and now it was time to go big.
            I started learning how to use Microsoft Excel, Word and PowerPoint. I began HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++ and Python; Started with Robotics, Raw Computing and Electrical Engineering as well.
            I just kept learning and learning, always a hundred steps ahead of everyone, but soon everyone began to catch up.
            I started programming and Robotics in a time when it wasn't well known by most people. In fact, nobody in my previous school, including most teachers, didn't know that Robotics actually existed.
            Nowadays everyone is running towards it, and the uniqueness I once had is now slowly becoming "Common".
            Frustration once again started to take hold and I began to question myself. What do I have to show for all those years of hard work? I have done a lot yet I have nothing decent or monumental to show.<br> Who am I?
        </p>

        <h3 class="colorWheel">Who I have become</h3>
        <p>
            I am Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, a 17-year old student. I am an attention seeker and try my best to be noticed.
            I am a people's person and get lonely quite easily. I like to make new friends and spend time with old ones, whether it's out to the movies or amusement parks, I always manage to make time.
            I love my parents and I help them out whenever possible. I like the feeling of independence, I prefer to buy things using my own money, I like to do my own chores or work and I like to build things on my own.
            Although, I still appreciate a helping hand every now and then. I know what my limits are, and I would still push against it, gaining a centimeter of progress every day, slowly but surely. I know what I can't control and am alright with it.
            I am a realist who always takes the third person's perspective when making important decisions, free from any arbitrary biases. I tend to see what others can't and somehow still miss the most obvious details.
            I am not a natural born leader but when the situation asks of me I will step up, just as I have all these past year. Even if I can't give a world class performance, I certainly can give a performance you won't forget.

        <h1 class="colorWheel">Draft 3.5 (ChatGPT and Grammarly's revision of Draft 3)</h1>
        <p>There was a time when I was always second, sometimes third, and sometimes even lower. I could never be the one standing in front of the class as everyone clapped. The language was a struggle, Chemistry & Biology overwhelmed me with memorization, and History felt tedious. Eventually, I resigned myself to being average. "Who wants to be first, anyway?" I thought. Then, in 4th grade, we were introduced to our school’s computer lab. For our first practical task, our teacher asked us to draw a water bottle in MS Paint. To my surprise, I finished in minutes while others struggled. For the first time, I was the very best. And with that came the question: "Why stop here?"</p>
        <p>Finding my spark in tech, I dove headfirst into everything I could: learning Excel, Word, PowerPoint, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python, and more. I explored robotics and electrical engineering, driven by the thrill of being ahead. But as tech’s popularity grew, I began to lose the edge that had once made me unique. Frustration crept in, and I questioned myself: "What do I have to show for all these years?" While I had learned a lot, I felt like I had nothing truly monumental to prove it. I wanted to create something representing all my hard work, to finally answer the question:<br> Who am I?</p>
        <p>I am Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, a 17-year-old passionate about exploring, building, and pushing limits. I love connecting with people, making friends, and balancing independence with a helping hand when needed. I take pride in helping my parents and savor the feeling of doing things independently. I’m not a natural-born leader, but I step up when the situation calls for it, aiming to deliver a memorable impact. I know what I can control and have learned to be at peace with what I cannot. With every step I take, I strive to leave a mark—not by following the usual path, but by blazing my own.</p>
