        <p>Born in the city of Lahore, Pakistan; I am someone who has had a fascination with the world of science and technology from when I was just a toddler. I have worked on numerous projects and, in the previous year, vastly increased the scope of my capabilities. I now have a good foundation for <strong>Software Development</strong> including desktop applications and web applications; I am an expert, as much as a 17-year-old should be, in <strong>Robotics</strong>; I am well acquainted with <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> concepts and practices and recently I have even begun to dabble in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. Though I suppose you are not here to read this.</p>
        <p>Frankly speaking, I am an attention seeker. In fact, I started Robotics and Computer Science at the early age of 12 so that I would be praised for being early for it. Moreover, I am also very social and like to spend as much time with my friends as possible. I try to make as many memories as I can during the short period of time that we are together.</p>
        <p>I have always been among the popular "fun" people to be around in school. Therefore, I was known by almost half the entire student body in both of the two schools I have been in, when I was there atleast.</p>
        <p>Enough talk about my school life and friends, let's go deeper starting with my personality. I am <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a bit</span> very lazy. As a matter of fact, I finish my tasks at the deadline but I assure you I don't leave anything overdue. I also eat a lot for a guy with my build, but I don't ever gain weight because I run a lot while playing sports such as <strong>Football</strong>, <strong>Table Tennis</strong> and <strong>Badminton</strong>. On the other hand I am also excellent in my academics, though there are ups and downs which I must admit.</p>
        <p>Next up are my preferences and hobbies; I don't listen to a wide variety of music, only something with a meaning or a context such as songs regarding a video game or a popular TV Show. I also listen to motivational-ish music. My favorite band being <strong>Imagine Dragons</strong>, followed by <strong>The Score</strong> and <strong>The Skillet</strong>. I watch a <strong>LOT</strong> of movies and have watched many action thriller, Superhero movies, Sci-fi movies and even psychological movies my favorite of which is titled as <strong>"Fractured"</strong></p>
