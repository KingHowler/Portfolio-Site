      I had begun Programming and Robotics since the young age of 12, much earlier than others.
      Though, my teachers often praised my knowledge of the 2 fields at that young age.
      I had begun my journey from using a simple led from a broken toy car.
      It was a trivial thing as I see it now, but back then it gave me joy and a sense of accomplishment.
      Now I have created many tools and have experience in wide variety of topics including, but not limited to, Software Development and Digital Electronics.

      At first glance it may seem like programming is all I can do but the truth is, I am also a sports person and an avid book-reader.
      During my O levels, my main sport was Football but I had also occasionally played Volleyball with my friends.
      I have spent the entirety of my A levels playing Table Tennis and Badminton.

      When it comes to books I must admit that my interest in fiction began from Harry Potter.
      Indeed, I mostly read fiction but when I am always looking for character development.
      Anticipating the decisions and paths of both the protagonist and antagonist has always been an enjoyable way to pass time for me, not to mention it also allows me to get a unique perspective to the story.
      My favorite novel series is <em>Nevernight Chronicles</em> by <em>Jay Kristoff</em>.
      He offers an interesting story full of plot-twists and fascinating characters, truly a masterpiece in my opinion.
