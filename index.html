        <p>Born in the city of Lahore, Pakistan; I am someone who has had a fascination with the world of science and technology from when I was just a toddler. I have worked on numerous projects and, in the previous year, vastly increased the scope of my capabilities. I now have a good foundation for <strong>Software Development</strong> including desktop applications and web applications; I am an expert, as much as a 17-year-old should be, in <strong>Robotics</strong>; I am well acquainted with <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> concepts and practices and recently I have even begun to dabble in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>. Though I suppose you are not here to read this.</p>
